```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

#List of variables
source("Variables.R", local = knitr::knit_global())
```

# Import libraries and the HRS dataset

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)

hrs <- read_sav("randhrs1992_2018v1.sav") %>% 
  select(all_of(Variables))
```

# Clean the dataset

1. Exclude respondents who didn't respond but alive in any wave (n=28,561)

```{r}
hrs <- hrs %>% 
  #Exclude cases with no response but alive
  filter_at(vars(ends_with("IWSTAT")), all_vars(.!=4)) %>% 
  #Exclude cases with no response, don't know if alive or died
  filter_at(vars(ends_with("IWSTAT")), all_vars(.!=9))
```

2. Select respondents and spouses with discrepant marital status in any wave (n=27,406)

```{r}
hrs <- hrs %>% 
  #Exclude cases with discrepant marital status
  filter_at(vars(ends_with("MSTATF")), all_vars(!(. %in% seq(2, 6))))
```

3. Select respondents who have married and then widowed (n=3,571)

```{r}
hrs_widow <- hrs %>% 
  #Filter out cases with marital history of only marriage and widowhood
  filter_at(vars((ends_with("MSTATH") & (starts_with("R")))),
            all_vars(. %in% c(NA, 1, 7))) %>%
  #Filter out cases who entered widowhood in any wave
  filter_at(vars((ends_with("MSTATH") & (starts_with("R")))),
            any_vars(.==7)) %>%
  #Exclude cases who were widows/widowers when entering the survey
  filter_at(vars((ends_with("MSTATH") & (starts_with("R")))),
            any_vars(.==1))
```

4. Exclude cases with multiple deceased spouses

5. Join and rename exit variables for the deceased spouse
